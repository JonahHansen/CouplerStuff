# CouplerStuff
Random scripts for calculating coupler/fringe tracking things

* science combiner scribble pdf: Some maths concerning AC/Tri combiners
* group_delay.py: Calculates the fringe intensity, with some glass dispersion. Currently plots intensity against delay
* tricombiner.py: tricoupler related simulations (i.e coupler length, phase change)
